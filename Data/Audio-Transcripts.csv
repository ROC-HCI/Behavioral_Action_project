The university has a collection of about 150,000 public and private letters fromWilliam Henry Seward, who was the Secretary of State to Abraham Lincoln.  These letters were collected over time by his family members, and then, in the 1960s they were donated to the university.  The way the university got in touch with these letters was, at the time, a professor, Glyndon Van Deusen, was working on a biography on Seward, and so, he got in contact with the living family members, who happened to live about an hour east of here.  And, so, the family began to trust Van Deusen and, uh, upon the death of the patriarch the letters were donated to the university.For the most part these letters have not been touched since the initial donation, and, so, the cool part about working on the project is that I'm working with letters that have not been seen by researchers before.  The letters are, umm, umm, they're in a wide range.  They're, f, the, the majority of them are from the 1860s;  which is fantastic because that's the time of the United States Civil War was going on.  And, so, there's not a lot of primary documents from this time that haven't been overly researched already.One of the coolest documents is Seward's daughter, Fanny Seward, had a diary at the time, and, so, this diary's very similar to Anne Frank's diary from World War II in that it's giving, it's providing researchers in-depth descriptions of the world of a little girl in the time of the Civil War.  Um, Fanny often describes, uh, sh, Fanny often follows around her father at the time he was Secretary of State, so, numerous, uh, extravagant events where she's meeting all sorts of politicians at the time.  And, we can see her personal views of these people who, for the most part in history, are given overly, uh, exaggerated descriptions in terms of how wonderful they are.  And, so, it's interesting to see what some, how people thought of them at the time versus how we think of them now.The project is digitizing these papers and getting them online.  We're also transcribing them because they wrote in cursive and their handwriting was not great.  And, so, the researchers that are working on the project become familiar with the handwritings and that way it'll be easier for people to just read a Word document that has everything very clearly.  The website we formatted with the scans of the original letters on one side, and then we transferred to on the other side, and that way users can look at both sides, er, look at both the original and the transcription at the same time and follow along very easily.",,,10.1

Class tech is a division of IT where our focus is to help professors. Unlike the regular IT help desk at the IT center their mostly focused on helping students with laptop issues, usually connecting to the network or if their hard drives fail. Difference with Class tech is that we're not only helping professors outside of the classrooms but in the classrooms. In the classrooms we have a number of classroom tools such as projectors, overheads, document camera's, and we're also in charge of the facilities of the room such as the lights, temperature, cleanliness. Majority of our um calls are troubleshooting calls, and so the number of times where a professor's laptop won't project onto the system because they haven't been using the, that room lately or there is something wrong with their laptop. And so most of the time we're running around campus were on call to help their classrooms continue properly. I got involved in class tech in my sophomore year my friend told me about it and I had also been told by a former instructor that I should apply to class tech because I was always helping her set up her lectures uh just because I was familiar with the tools. One such tool that we install in most of our classrooms is a touch panel and we have a Creston programmer who creates these. The touchpanels are very useful for professors in that there very easy to use and they basically controls the room. So there's an option for lights and then when the instructor touches that option a display will come up that shows they can either have all the lights on or two-thirds, one-third in some rooms it controls sections of lights individually. That's usually in our larger lecture halls. The touch panel also gives them the ability to access all sorts of different inputs from one place. So let's say the instructor has their laptop connected but the room also has a VCR/DVD combo, it also has a document camera, and there's also a Panopto system. So from the touch panel the instructor can with the touch of a button get to each of these systems. Panopto systems are not installed in most of our classrooms it's a newer system where we can set up automatic recording or lectures. This is great for professors who are often out of town in that they can come to a classroom and record a lecture beforehand. Also, students miss a lecture then they are free to view it online through blackboard. Over the summer at classroom technology we perform a lot of system upgrades were also in charge of managing all of the computer labs on campus and so recently we installed all in one computers into all of the rooms and once physically installing them we also had to install a new image for the students to use with all of the software that's requested by professors.",,,10.2

I started playing ultimate disk, or frisbee which is what it's sometimes called still, in high school, uh in intramurals. I always loved playing frisbee. It was a great way to get away while running cross-country. We would often, when going on a run, go a couple miles down the road and then when we were supposed to be running, we would wind up playing ultimate instead.  And we would come back and be all sweaty and say ""oh yeah, we definitely went for a ten mile run today, can't you tell?"" But I definitely liked that aspect of cross-country a lot more than just the running itself. And so in college I knew, instead of just running track, I wanted to play ultimate. Ultimate's a great team sport, it's seven on seven. The game begins with a pull to one side, similar to football where you have a kickoff. And then you need to slowly work the disk up the field into an endzone, again similar to football. The key is: once you catch the disk, you cannot move. You can pivot on one foot, so I'm a rightie, so I can pivot on my left foot. And then in the meantime, a defender can come up to me and they need to count to ten seconds. At the end of ten seconds, if I still have the disk, then that's called a stall. And it's overturned to the other team.  There are many kinds of posit-, well there're two main positions in frisbee, at the organized level. There's handlers and there're cutters. So the traditional format for most college teams now is to have three handlers and four cutters. Handlers are usually players who have stronger disk skills and as such they'll fulfill more of a quarterback-like role, where they'll be the ones throwing those more difficult throws. Cutters are usually faster people, or taller people. So I'm a cutter, because I'm lean and tall. And so, we'll be the ones catching the disk, similar to a wide receiver in football. Um so essentially the way the disk is usually moved up the field is a handler will throw to a cutter, and the cutter will either be cutting in toward where the handler is or cutting out on a deep cut. Since there are four cutters at a time though, y- the handler has a number of options. If during the ten second period, a handler doesn't have a good opportunity to make a throw to a cutter, then they can do what's called a swing and they can throw it to another one of their two handlers, who are often cutting around just to get into open space.  If the handler does make a successful throw to a cutter, then the cutter -- if they aren't the greatest at throwing, such as me -- ah will make what's called a dump pass, where they basically dump the disk back to a handler.  Ideally, there'll be fluid movement between the players so that a handler can make a throw to a cutter, the cutter will -- within two stalls -- throw it back to the handler and then hopefully make a deep cut after that. And the handler can throw it to them. And they'll score.",,,10.3

Umm the story follows a group of some washed up stage actors as they try to put together a Broadway down production, by dealing with personal problems, bad memories, stick set malfunctions, and compass character flaws. Umm all of being not necessarily yelled at, but encouraged quite firmly by somewhat stressed director. Umm the movies you need in one sense that it shows something from the perspective of behind the scene from an actual production which is not a very common perspective in a theater or a movie. Umm, but also that it lies in a small niche which I'd like to call intelligence lab-stick where you have long scenes of well timed and detailed physical comedy sketches, but at the same time having plot threads running through the background, character development, and enough stuff going on that you can watch it over and over again, and still if not get something new out of it, at the very least enjoy it each time. The other thing that has always has stetted me about the film has curliness. No one seems to have heard of this, and this is despite not only the fact that it is incredibly good, and unique film, but the cast is almost entirely made up of famous or otherwise all known actors. The primary cast is filled by the likes of Michael Kayne, Carol Burnett, Christopher Reeve, Nicollette Sheridan, and others as well. Umm its incredibly funny, and it really is a film for those who if not a part of at least have an interest or some knowledge of the way a play or a stage is set up, because all the, not only can those people can appreciate the intricate timings, but they can also laugh hysterically at all the things that they have probably experienced going wrong themselves.",,,13.2

For some people, it's a lack of inspiration, for others its a worry that or fear that asking these strange questions will lead to strange and worrying places or places that don't make sense.

Since then, this passion for violin has developed into passions for all forms of music. In addition to the violin, I also play the saxophone. Its a fun instrument and its reminiscence of the golden age of jazz, blues, swing, big band. It's a lot of fun to play. In addition, I also play the Duduk, which is an Armenian instrument, that has this haunting tone that's kind of fun. It's a lilting haunting tone that will allow anyone to get up and dance and have fun with it. I also play the Quena, which has this haunting tone that will send chills up anyone's spine. In addition to these instruments, I play the Piano, which is an older instrument. I can play classical music, but I can also play signor music, pop, rock, piano has gained its place among the big rock instruments. Uhh, the most famous example of this would probably me the union wraps put in my queen with its notable piano inter-booths. Another popular instrument for rock and pop that I play is the Guitar. Guitarist tend to be most easily recognizable to the people of this generation. I play the percussion, you can set a perfect beat, any anyone can follow onto it. I sing, granted singing is limited by the range of my vocal, of my voice, and its also limited by the words that I can come up with. However, I can still move people through the use of my own voice as opposed to anything else. Moving into the newer age, I can play rock style pieces, I can play guitar, bass guitar, electric violin, electric piano, and that appeals to a younger generation. You play a commonly known riff on a guitar or on the piano, and everyone instantly wants to sing along. So, I am able to move people of a younger generation, but the youngest generation is one of electronic music. This is a generation of dub-step and synthesized music. As much as I just like dub-step and synthesized music, I can also play a couple of synthetic music. I am able to play music on my computer in real time using a programming language called Chuck. I can also play an unusual electronic instrument called [??]  which uses a unique system of notes whereas one key does not represent a single note, it actually represents an interval plus a half step minus a half step, you get the idea.

However, there is some inpersonalization caused by using a computer, and not being on to have face to face in their interactions. You can share information freely, you can post pictures, share your emotions, share old memories all for free online with no cost and no real struggle, you can do all of it from the comfort of your home. You can meet your old friends online by searching up your high school, checking up for your graduation, and you can see how people live their lives over the past few years and reform all friendships. You also can meet new friends through mutual friendships. You can find people that you never knew, and find new perceptions from them and become friends and form a friendship. However, the impersonalisation makes it easy for people to use Facebook for recreational purposes. They can create, make a sad status into when its a funnier joke just by a play of words, it can get a little picky about the grammar, all because they're not actually there. Its just one computer talking to another computer, and not two people talking to another person. So, the impersonalisation makes Facebook not the ideal form of social interaction. Facebook also make the rise in social media usage has also, I mean living given to a rise in identity theft, and the lack of security when Facebook is its kinda difficult to use. Well informed users can protect their information, but the default setting for Facebook allows all images to be seen by anyone. You could see people's email address, you can see their phone numbers, sometimes their address even, all just you don't even have to be friends with them, you don't have to live in their area. So this is not the best system. It makes it too easy for people to harass other people without having to meet them. Straight interest can stalk your profile, even people in your own community can follow you and see your images and see where you are and what you're doing, and how you are feeling, and they never have to meet you. It takes away the fundamental part of human interaction and makes it not a completely different way of socializing. Facebook is very useful for connecting with people. Its messenger is very helpful, you can video chat, you can connect with people all the way across the world, and that's very nice, but there are some downsides to Facebook, and those in degree people into notice that this isn't ideal that there needs to be a better way to talk to other people.

Uh recently Apple has announced their use of an IWatch and I think that, while not necessarily being the next big thing, marks a keystone achievement into technology and society. First time I see wearables, and this integration of technology into a much more personal level than simply our phones or our computers at home. We're starting to see that we can use technology everywhere, which there already is everywhere, in a sense, integrating into our daily lives to help us do what we need to do on a day to day basis, and the other things that we might not even be familiar with, things that we might need to do once in a lifetime. I think we're going to see a expansion of wearables and technology integrate into our um products we use every day, like washers, dryers, even your refrigerator. I am personally looking forward to a future where your refrigerator that's always fully stocked by itself. I think these innovations like this while they may, at first, seem to apply to only first-world applications will lead to technologies that can help everyone, around the world. Because you'll be able to perform services to test when there's not even enough people or enough resources, but still be able to uh help those who need help.  Um, I think that in the future, we're going to see things like self-driving cars, and robotic chefs and all sorts of crazy things that we can't really predict yet. But, though, they'll be there because there's this unstoppable march forward of of time and of progress. Especially in first-world countries such as uh America or Japan surprisingly at the forefront of technology. Um, it's that this progress has been shown if you look at the things like the adaptions of home computers, and smart phones, and anything like that, that there is a market. And people will buy these things, and other people will definitely develop them. That's all my time.",,,17.1

So, its interesting to see what actually comes up, what becomes the most well known, the most zillion thoughts in these sorts of groups. It gets kind of interesting to see you know sometimes there is this one sort of thing that anyone has stuck, there's another sort of thing, its kind of different categories that you see that they fall into. New things where people participate for instance like the recent Facebook ice bucket challenge. Uhh you view things simply images that people share with their friends over and over again, you see very often the simple form of just an image to text that is just so ambiguous that it can be seen everywhere, and also its online communities. So, I think now is interesting to see what sort of content arises the top, what sort of new content gets created, gets adopted the most, and what sort of uhh communities adopt what sort of content and whose connected to who. There's a lot of research going on now about connectivity in things like Facebook, and seeing social networks where I think that its now important to see  who is actually talking to who, and who spends with who. That's all the social network derive from the real world, the offline world. Its interesting to see what sort of people kind of connect with a lot of other people once we get online. I guess you must have also seen this with things like, like dating websites which really are becoming like really popular now. You see that large amounts of people go online, and now you are not restricted by simple who you know and who is around who you interact with. You have this access to everyone else who also decided, hey let's try this and its interesting to see what works.",,,17.2

You haven't heard of it. Its those crazy you tube videos of people jumping from building to building you know. That's kind of a public image of. But, that's not really what it is. That's not really actually what it was meant to be. Uhh park war is the idea of getting through an area using your own motion in as sufficient manner as possible. This maybe something that you do natural, maybe something that you really have to work on. Different people have different original abilities, and things like high and building everything also affects things, which is why its actually hard to make something where you can just show off, or compete against other people, because there are so many factors that are just based on your body type. But, its a really fun activity. Originally, I used to do more weights and running and things like that, but once I started doing park war, all those started to seem rather boring. You're just doing the same thing over and over again, and with park war, there's all kinds of new stuff constantly going on. There's different kinds of abilities, there is things like walking on a force, there is climbing over obstacles, or vaulting over obstacles, there is even running up walls. All these fun stuff is balancing and running, and its always different. Your surroundings are always changing at the place where I practice this. There is all this different things going out and they change it from time to time. So that even if you get used to going up a wall or you get used to taking particular route of an area, eventually they're gonna switch it up, and now you've gotta figure things out again. So, there's all this improvisation. You'll have a lot of option. There is a lot of different ways you can jump on things, or get through things, you may go above, you may go below, you may go around,  all kinds of different stuff. So, its a very creative sort of activity, its a fun creative way of exercising, and its something that I think a lot of people don't really understand about it is that its not to competitive like I said before, and another nice thing about it is that you don't have anything but yourself when you're moving around. So, if you're doing something like skateboarding or skiing, you have these tools that you are using to get around. Not only does that mean you have to purchase these things or rent them before you can actually do anything, but it means that things may go wrong just because one of these things fails or you  don't really understand how to use them all. So for example on skateboard, you may misjudge something and it slips out from under you or there is weird bump in the road that you did't see. With park war, its just you, its your hands and your feet, and as you move through things you can feel where you are going, you can decide how hard or easy you wanna make your path. You can decide what your limitations are, and if you feel like surpassing them or you just feel like kind of playing around in the area, and that's really a park war.",,,18.2

Umm, but my favorite class by far in the three weeks that I have been on campus, has been Computer Science, and there's a couple of reasons for that. So, well I have programs uhh in the past, I umm, I am an intra-course here, but that is fine for me, because while I am reviewing some things, its so much fun for me especially to do the homework and to do the labs for Computer Science class.Because, uhh for me the ability to create something out of nothing, umm as abstract as that sounds, to be able to just type, to be able to type and create a seemingly relevant uhh words and symbols, and to create something of visual display, an application, a equation, and doing something with that is amazing for me, and it will never be stop amazing uhh even if I am a software developer for the next 60 years, I am pretty sure I will go to work everyday, and be amazed by that. So, what like, for example, umm the first lab we did you know we're taking Hello Worlds, and taking umm input from the users and plugging in your equation, but very simple things that should have, it should have taken like 20 minutes halved, but I ended up going in the library at like one in the afternoon, and I came out at like six'o clock, because I just got so into it, and there is like 10% e-way umm for labs where you can go above and beyond, you can get 10% actual creativity points, and I kinda took that way too far and I had this whole like text base inventor where you're literally just trying to make an equation, and you set plug into numbers, but its a whole adventure, and I love the fact that I can do that and that's something that I don't think can be offered in other fields like Biology, or umm Mechanical Engineering. You can't take, you can't take it above and beyond and create something, because you actually have to use there is physical impulse there, and you can't just go crazy, and that's the thing you can do with electronics and with computers that is so amazing for me. And, on the topic, another thing I'd like to do in my spare time which isn't exactly for my class, but as a side ten-gen, I love to create create video games and develop them, and that's, that's another thing where you can create a whole world, you can create powers, you can create adventures, you can create anything you want. It's all limited by what you can imagine, and that's something which is amazing for me, and that's why I love to do that. I love to make games that are in, that are in a zombie apocalypse, or good evil times, because that is something that we can can't do in real life, and we can do through computers. So I will be in it forever ever for that, and I will keep up with my CS class.",,,19.1

So I have to come clean and that past-time is to play board games. And I'm not talking about, you know, your Monopoly, your Risk, or your Scrabble um, but more of these crazy European board games that cost a hundred dollars and have ten pounds of wooden components in them and they sprawl across a ten person table. Um, and these board games they require strategy they require competition, um, collaboration, uh anticipation, seeing what everyone else is going to do, what the game is going to do, and they widely vary they can be from genres future to to stone age to modern day anything, and while I love um computer games I love being able to play Super Smash Bros or Cow Lady with friends, it offers that same peer interaction, it doesn't offer than face to face value that can be gained from a tabletop game. One game um in particular that comes to mind it's it's called Robinson Crusoe Adventure on Cursed Island and in this game you're with 3 other people and you're all stranded on different parts of the island , say one person has a stick, another person has a stone, another person found a banana grove, and you need to meet up while while working together while trying to not die obviously on the island you need to meet up, you need to build shelter, you need to survive, you need to create a raft and escape the island and while that sounds crazy, like all that is fit into a board game. A board game where you have to work with, work with your peers and learn from your peers and I think that's extremely valuable. And the reason I actually got into this in the first place was because of a teacher in sixth grade, um he invited me over to his house which is kind of a weird thing for a sixth grade teacher to um play board games with him and some of his friends and I was like OK, I I like this class so sure I'll go over. And what that, what I've learned as the years progress and I play with different people, not only my friends but like I said adults, and with this whole wide range of people, it brings you together in a way that it's not awkward to sit at a table for hours with another, with people you don't know at all. You learn so much about other people, how they think, and how they interact, and that's why I think board games are infinitely valuable, and I'll continue to play video games, I'll continue to love electronics, but I also need that interaction that can't be offered. And, as a final note, I will say that I brought some to college but I've not told my roommate or any of my hallmates about them yet. I just gotta find the right group and hopefully I'll do that by the end of the semester.",,,19.2

I I guess I don't quite understand when people watch documentaries or they watch History Channel and they learn things from television? Like I I understand using media as a learning outlet. I will sit in library and watch a forty minute um special on the Trojan War. Then I can learn from that. But I like to divide my time between entertainment and productivity. With a very very clear divisor. And the way I do it in college, I will sit in library for five hours straight and I will do all my work. But when I get back to my dorm at eleven? I don't think about, I I will not do work in my dorm. And one of the things I like to do while in my dorm, hum, my entertainment station, is is obviously Netflix. I love to binge binge watch Netflix. Like I I get made fun of this, made fun of for this but I have like an Ipad stand that arches over my bed, and it's set up and everything, I like special Netflix pillow and I get in my station and it's great.

Um because the cast is a, they're a crew of narcissists, hypocrites, um lazy people and um they own a bar together.  And and it's completely improbable. These people cannot cannot co-exist in the real world. But their interactions um within their bar, within their various scenes, um they're hilarious. Um they offer me just pure comedic value, nothing that I can take anything out of and think about like deeply the next day. But but I value the comedic value just as much. Just yesterday I was watching watching it at like two-thirty in the morning.  And I actually woke up my roommate because I laughing so hard. And and I felt terrible, I apologized the next day [laughter] and I had to like laugh into a blanket, but um that's what I like to take out of a TV show.

First, I am gonna be talking about my favorite TV show. I really like the show Nashville, it airs on ABC, and the third season is about to premiere next Wednesday. So, a little background about the show. Umm the show is set in National Tennessee, which is the capital of the Country Music, and it follows the lives of two women;  Juliette Barnes and Rayna Jaymes. So, Juliette is the equivalent of Taylor Swift. She is the younger hot teen sensation who is very glaring and glamorous whereas Rayna Jaymes is very, she is the queen of Country Music. She is the equivalent of Dolly Parton or Carrie Underwood, and they frequently have to work together, and you see the clash of old world versus new world, versus tradition versus you know new innovation and things like that. Umm my favorite part about the show is that it also has small stories of other you know waitresses, sales clerks, these women who are trying to become big country sensations, and it follows there movement as they speak to agents, they go to auditions. So, I really like that show, because of all the different ways that approaches Country Music, and I think its one of the first shows to really talk about what happens behind the scenes for Country Music. We see Country Music Awards, we see Tim McGraw, and all these huge artists, but there hasn't been a reality TV show or even just a drama show to talk about the behind the scenes, and I love Country Music, so I love seeing that, and the style of the filming is very nostalgic and traditional. So, its not like too intense, its not very suspenseful, its very easy going. I like watching it when I do the dishes or when I am doing my nails. So, its a good show to have. I mean, its a feel good show. There's always live music in it and since I love Country Music, why wouldn't I like that? and I also uhh, I also like the sporadic filming. Its weird, because it goes in and out the way its filmed which is a little different, and you're always following multiple stories at once. So, you have to keep track of Rayna is doing this, and Juliette is doing that, and then Deacon, and then Scarlett, but its fun because its kinda like real life. So, that's my favorite show uhh Nashville. I am really excited for the season premiere next Wednesday. Rayna has to decide between two people who just proposed to her. So, its super dramatic and  we're all waiting for the response, and I am hoping that season 3, uhh season premiere will tell us Rayna's choice and her husband.",,,20.1

I am going to talk about yoga I began doing yoga exactly two years ago this fall. I started when my mother convinced me to go to some classes uh at this place called the hot yoga studio. It's about a mile from my house so I can either bike there, walk there, or it's a two-minute car ride. So it's really convenient for me to go and she also got me the unlimited student pack package where I could go as many times as I want and since I am really, really cheap I thought I have to get my money's worth my mom already paid for it. So, I began going even though I didn't like yoga. So first you go in and it's very quiet. I judged a lot of the people that were there you know as this stereotypical yogi hippie people and there were times I actually took my friends and we would sit in the back and make fun of the people. It's very mean but it ended that was how I started and I was very skeptical about what yoga is I didn't want to do it but I was there because my mom had paid for it. So, after two or three weeks I actually began to really follow along with the movements before when it got to hard I would just sit on sit down and watch everyone else but I would continue doing the poses and I found myself getting stronger. When you do uh vin yosa flows which are a sequence of events that you do over and over again it actually is very strength developing its a lot having to do with your upper body and core strength and I found myself being able to you know carry large things  from up above on on my head for a long time like a box or something and I found that my muscle development was really accelerated. So, I started going and actually taking it seriously as an athletic endeavor, endeavor as opposed to something to do to relax and meditate. So, I began joining classes like bar classes which has to do with um cardio infused with yoga and then more like core power classes and at one point I was going every single day to a very intense immediate or expert level yoga class. I did that for about four months and I became extremely fit my lifestyle changed it was about going to yoga now. Not the other way around and my eating habits changed because I noticed how certain foods would make my energy lower after I would come back from yoga. So, it really changed my lifestyle and I continue to do it to this day but my favorite part about it is you don't need you know a partner or a specific ball or courts to do it. I do it in my room, I do it when I'm waiting for the bus, and I do it sometimes when I'm brushing my teeth. So, it's, it's really good to infuse it into your life which is why I love yoga so much.",,,20.2

I was first exposed to human computer interaction when I began working in San Francisco, in a start up called a Appurify. Appurify, was the pioneer of mobile application testing. So, we had a farm of over a thousand individual phones, iPad's, umm you know android, windows, nexus, all of the different kinds of phones that are in the market today, and the application allows you to log in to our app and upload your application if you are a developer, and choose which phones you want to test and then it makes the settings appropriate for your testing. For example, you can say that the phone had low memory, it was in Shanghai, it was through Verizon, and it had two bars, and you can test if your application will be able to work on that phone. You can run several other applications over and over again, you can run hundreds at once. So, my job uhh at the company was working with a group of front end developers and back end engineers to test the usability of the website. Not anything to do with the phones, but when someone entered our platform, if they could figure out how again what they want, and upload without difficulty. So, I was basically re-enacting used case scenarios in my courses, and I ended up really learning about users and to design. I had to take on different personas, and act as though I was a user and try and manipulate the system, trying to do this, trying to break it in a sense to make sure that there were no loop holes, there were no errors. So, when I decided to come back to school, I decided to do computer science and studio art, and I think the studio art combination with computer science really allows me to enter a world of user interaction. Design it allows me to think in an aesthetically pleasing way while also incorporating the user's needs and then also the technical needs. So, that's why my favorite class at this time is human computer interactions, because its what I am really passionate about, its what I wanna do, I wanna be a UX designer, and right now I am also an intern for, I am a UX designer for a start up in New York, where they're working with umm developing a new education platform where its a mix between blackboard and Facebook in one place, and I'm working as a UX designer for that, and everything that I am doing correlates with what I am learning in human computer interactions. So, that's my favorite class because its just what I love to do.",,,20.3

And a lot of people don't know that there's like a certain way that you're supposed to put on each one. So I learned that there's different things that have to go on top of each other to make sure it looks like professionally done. And people who are uh actually into makeup will notice it and compliment you actually on it. And the one thing I really learned is like is first before you put on anything you're looking to put blusher on because it like evens everything out, and you have to wait five to ten minutes for it to be done. And then you let it s- sink in and of course cool down, and you put on face primer because primer's important. It just makes everything goes on easier and last longer. It makes your skin look um, it just evens out the tone for when you want to put it on. Pause afterwards, as well as just making sure everything goes on smoothly and doesn't really go on very um cakey or um un-solid. Um as they would probably say, because everything would come out like in bulgish patches. And um so, first you'll put on ?? lotion and let that set, then you'll put on face primer, and make sure that it goes with your skin tone and then you put on foundation. Um usually foundation comes in either like, it comes in either like solids, um which is like the powder, or like a whipped creme kind, and then there's a liquid foundation which is personally not my favorite because it's very cakey and makes your skin feel very tight. And then afterward if you p-, if you're going to put on eye makeup, you have to like put on eye primer for your eyes, especially because it's a different material, all different types of skin versus the rest of your face. But when you um look to put on your foundation, be sure you put it all the way down to where like your neck is, because if you're wearing a tee-shirt, you gotta make sure your face matches your neck. Or it's gonna look weird. And then you put, after you put your eye primer on, you have to make sure to let that set because you have to make sure that soaks in. And then you put on your eye shadow. And after you put on your eye shadow, you put on your eyeliner,um mascara is usually the last thing you put on your eyes. Um the best thing is usually put the black eyeliner on the bottom lid or white eyeliner um on the bottom lid because if it's dry it looks better. Or it makes your eyes look a bit bigger and black eyeliner makes your eyes look smaller. Um and also make sure that you just make sure that both sides are even, if one side is thicker than the other it doesn't really look nice at all. People will notice that, especially people who are not into fashion or anything. And then afterwards you would um focus on your cheekbones. And usually we would just put on blush for that. And a very simple thing, um first you just like to use a regular brush for um for your cheeks. And it would blend very well. And then afterwards, you're just going to put um lipstick on, and that's completely up to you how however you to want to design that. Some people put lip liner on, that's up to you. And then you use bronzer and then.",,,21.2

So it's different we're in Rochester because Rochester kinda doesn't have the same seasons as they would in other places. So like typically, in the fall, New York City does a Fashion week and those would show like clothes you would wear this fall. Since in Rochester summer kinda like extends a little longer and kinda goes into a direct winter cuz the weather gets really cold, there's not really in-between for fall. So a lot of people don't really wear fall clothing here. But when you do, if you ever do go back into like one of those major cities, you're going to see people actually follow the fashion, um, the trend that they're supposed to. So like in the fall you're typically wearing a lot of plaid and lot of black. A lot of...mostly it's like black leggings for people, in like, red plaid, not like purple or the blue plaid that most people wear. It's like strictly like the ones that you wear as a path, like school spirit. But they may be a little more, um, like edgy for the season. And usually, we'll, in addition to that, they have like typical fall colors. So those are like orange, red, gold, yellow and brown. They mostly like match the colors of autumn leaves that you typically see. It's supposed to just like tie everything together in like a season feel. So a lot of people don't wear those colors here in Rochester because it still feels like, it's still like um winter-ish and still summerish.  So people tend to use the colors in between that. So people just don't choose to dress according to the, according to the weather. Which is usually okay, but usually like fashion-wise it's not appropriate to do it because even though during the fall you do wear the colors you're supposed to wear, supposed to like coordinate with like the weather.  And same thing in the winter, that's like the harder time for like the seasons where people don't really make a lot of sales. Because are more concerned about like going with the weather than going with what's going in the summer. It's much easier to do both together in all reality. Like people are really not aware that like wearing a simple petticoat actually goes not only with the weather but making sure you're warm.  It also goes along with wearing for the season cuz cuz petticoats are really like a big thing in the, in the fall. But here in Rochester they really don't wear those things. And so people usually just wear their revolting like Columbia coats. Those are the ones that you see in the fall, not only in the fall but the winter. But that's okay I guess um really no one really cares since we're all college students. Saturday they could put us with brown, wearing like sweatpants.",,,21.3

Arrow on The CW channel follows the life of Oliver Queen umm who at night dresses up as green arrow superhero in order to go and fight crime. Umm he in the first season follows a book that his dad left, when he, when they're both stranded up in the island, umm and he proceeds to talk to the people in the book, and make sure that they are not corrupting his city. Umm, but as the show goes on, he learns some secrets of his family, and the second season he takes everything in his own hands, and tries to make clean up the city for good. Uhh, this green arrow is actually umm a DC comics superhero, and he is, he is very very interesting, his advance story is very interesting, and umm this all started when he was stranded on an island where umm 5 years where his boat uhh got shipwrecked. Umm his dad killed himself in order to give him all the supplies that he needs in order to survive uhh for the amount of time that he will be there. Umm, and that's also when he gives him this book, and he suffers a lot on that island, he gets tortured, he has to hunt for himself, and umm and there is a lot of things going on. For example, he meets this one character Slade Wilson, umm who is good with him, they're both good friends, and they try and help each other out, but he actually gets injected with this serum  when he is dying, and it turns into this super human being, and then he can't control his rage, and so that's when they decide to break it off, and they can't be really together anymore, and that kinda hurts a little, and also Slade's and Oliver's love interest has to die, kind a part where its because of Oliver's fault and Slade is also angry, because of that, and so its very interesting cause it comes out of this island completely as he goes in as a 25 year old playboy who you know just cares about getting drug, and not doing anything with his life other than partying. He comes out as this responsible human being umm who's clearly been through a lot in his life, and umm he now vows to spend his time doing something better, umm and he also has two other character on the show who uhh one is kinda bodyguard. He was appointed as a bodyguard, but became his umm I guess Psychic or a partner in crime, and umm then there is also Felicity, who is his maths genius, and she every time something goes wrong, she is right there umm helping out with them, and its really interesting to see this umm trio fight crime, and kind of go through you know a more human experience of fighting crime you know because, Oliver's very well aware of what he's doing. He's just not going there to kill people for fun, he's doing that because its his duties. He promised his father that he had to do this, and so its interesting to see him cope with everything, cope with his father's loss, cope with his friends who dies umm later on in season on, and cope with everyone around him you know, getting jailed or drying. His mother dies, so you know its just its very humane to see a character go through all this and still be so willing to help out a city umm by fighting crime at night, and umm rest of the story crime is very interesting.",,,23.1

However my favorite superhero is Aquaman and that I, he's my favorite for a lot of different reasons. Um, first off, a lot of people complain about his powers and how they're pretty useless in um real life. And I disagree with that because um it's a well-known fact that the earth is 94 percent covered by water. Um and so, a lot of people think of him as just controlling um sea animals that are really just sea animals and they really can't do anything on land. However, um, he has a lot more powers to him than that. Um and actually the sea animal controlling comes into effect later on. Um what it is, a prominent power that you can see while he's on land is um his superhuman strength, his speed, his um flexibility and everything. This actually occurs because he is adapted to live underwater. And so obviously, because of the density of water, um, you have to have stronger muscles in order to move underwater, that's why you're sore after a swim. Um and so, when you come back on land, you're stronger and you're faster and you can lift cars. And that's exactly who Aquaman is. Another one of his powers is um, well as you know, he has power to um c- like control um like animals in the sea. Um this is actually really cool because he can actually learn any language on earth because of his telekinetic abilities. I'm just kinda going to read your mind and go along with it. Um and that's something no one knows. That's something when I tell people they are really surprised and say ""oh, that's actually really cool."" And so I say ""yeah, you should do a little more research"".  And um, it's really, it's not really just his superpowers that make him interesting. It's also because he's he's the only one that can really fight in water and on land.  Um, he can fight crime, not fight crime underwater, but you know he can make sure that everythings's okay. And stuff does happen underwater, and a lot of pretty terrifying things happen underwater. He really keeps control of that. And he really keeps the earth safe from any underwater beings surfacing. And also, and also he can fight crime over water because of his super strength and ability and all of that. He can um easily defeat um, easily defeat any sort of um people that, you know, robberies or anything like that. And he's often seen doing that a lot. And even when he's on land, and actually in the newest comic series you see him kind of being made fun of, so it actually kind of goes meta. You see him being made fun of for being uh some sea creature and not being to do anything on land. But as the comic book progresses, you see him being really important and really uh, I guess, making a difference. Um so, I think it's just important for people to understand who Aquaman is before they make their judgment. Um so I think people would really like him if they actually took the time to learn about him. And they actually...okay.",,,23.2

We had the Lego movie, which obviously touched a lot of people's hearts, people from the eighties who have pl-, you know grown with the little space man toy growing up, to kids now who have a lot of uh a bigger choice of legos. Um and then there was 22 Jump Street, which was absolutely hilarious and one that was supposed to be much better than the first movie. However my favorite movie, I'll have to say, is Godzilla. And the reason I say Godzilla is the best movie so far for me is simply because giant monsters. Uh coming in I didn't really, I didn't, I guess know much about Godzilla. I mean I knew that he was a giant terrifying monster, that's really all about it.  I'd only seen snippets of the movies, so I didn't really know what I was getting into but I knew that I wanted to see it. And my Dad wanted to see it on Imax so I was happy to um see it in um such a big screen.  It just completely encapsulating all of my senses. It was just amazing. Um while a lot of people complain about how the story went, um that maybe the main character was in there a little too much and there sh- should be more Godzilla, and that Brian Caronsen died, which was really just surprising. And a bad choice in my opinion. Um everyone agrees that the Godzilla scenes, Godzilla monster fighting scenes were absolutely phenomenal and absolutely well done and it was just amazing. Um, uh, it made everyone feel like a little kid again and, you know, people were cheering and clapping and whooping in the you know movie theater. And this is something you don't see a lot you know. No matter how good the movie is, you don't see people uh just being so compelled, just so interested in the movie that they're physically reacting to it. Um obviously parts where, the first part, when you first see Godzilla in the airport scene and he just roars when he sees the monster, everyone just clapped. It was just amazing to see. It was just I can't even explain how amazing it felt to see that and it was just, it was phenomenally done.  Um and the part where he first unleashes his atomic breath on the other monsters, that's something I'll never forget. I mean I was too spellbound by the movie to actually notice anything, but people around me were just freaking out. And it was just an amazing experience and I just, I personally, I completely agree with them. They were shouting and screaming, it was just so great. I mean seeing his tail light up like that was just absolutely beautiful. And it just, it evoked a little kid inside me. And it doesn't have to always have to be about plot devices, or uh you know, character development or all that. Sometimes it's just about giant monsters fighting giant monsters. And  we really we shouldn't, you know no matter how much you say that you didn't like it, it really should be about, you know, monsters fighting and it's just being phenomenal at what they do.",,,23.3

Hello, today I'd like to talk about a habit of mine which is running. So, running is a special form of a daily habit for myself, because since, since of young age my father had brought me up to run in the mornings and in the afternoon, and part of which why I like running a lot is during the process of running, you can see many different sides of the city. You can run up to the Curfew park, you could umm you could see beautiful sceneries above forces, above rivers, so that's one of the reasons why I like running. So, the second reason why I like running is because of, because of the health benefits you get from running. For example; in the morning, I cannot start the day before running, because running helps me to uhh rejuvenate my body, it helps me feel energized, uhh it makes me catch my breath if start running really fast, and after feels really good after a good run, and uhh an addition to that is because after having a perhaps a strong workout in the morning, I might have a build up more appetite to uhh eat more in the morning, and that would help me get uhh some of the nutritions I must get in the morning for examples; in the morning I would definitely eat a lot of fruit, uhh perhaps oranges, fruits start. I am required and uhh perhaps more of an empty stomach to absorb, so it would be really helpful in the morning, if I run and then eat fruit. Uhh another benefit I feel is that, it helps me learn, because everyday uhh running, before running and after running, I anticipate to run and that helps me uhh look forward to something, and in the afternoon I know that I have been re-energized, and I am ready to study and I am ready to learn. Umm, this is really obvious and uhh so I start my classes in the morning uhh especially 9 AM classes, uhh because often if I have kind of experimented or have experiences where I didn't go for a run in the morning, for example; I'd pick up a day, take a shower, and then take breakfast, I would feel actually more tired and I would be uhh if I hadn't taken a run. So, that's one of the main reasons I have been running everyday. Uhh, another reason why I like to run perhaps in the afternoon is because in this afternoon sessions, uhh I would invite friends, uhh family to go join with me. So, usually in the afternoon runs, I would take it easy. Uhh for example, I would take it easy because uhh in the morning I ran, so would be more of a run than I would try to relax myself. I would engage and uhh have meaningful conversations with my friends, my family, we'd talk about all what's happening in our life, what we're worrying about all that and I think running is a really good median for myself to communicate to my friends, to my family, about how I am these days, and I think that's mainly because why I like to run everyday.

So this author I encountered when I was sixteen, uh one of the most important time periods of a youth, I would say. During that period I had uh several difficulties, several, several puzzlements or situations that would really make me, would make me slow down and think. And one of the, one of the authors or one of his books inspired me to really have some meaningful discussions with my parents, with my friends, about just life in general. So this author's name is uh Malcolm Gladwell. So besides uh books he has, for example he has Blink, uh Curious Incidents of the Dog are some of the books he has, he has several talks on TED as well. So his variation in his field also makes me very excited about him, himself. So I'm going to talk a little bit about one of his talks, which I like, like the most. Is his recently, about two years ago, he went on TED to talk about sort of a David and a Goliath. So normally the story would be quite simple uh for everybody, everybody who has read the Bible or who has heard about it. But the way he tackles this story is he shows uh how the character of uh Goliath and the character of David has played different impacts on the outcome. And he also shows how uh how, how actually in the modern view, how would David actually kill the giant Goliath?  So one of the most surprising things about that story he told is that he illustrated how uh how we would think that a slingshot in that period of time was was uh was uh inefficient. He showed that how uh using a sl-, how the power of the slingshot, if we really think deeply about the physics view is almost uh half of the power of what a, a quarter of the power of what a gun can do these days. So it shows how um misconceptions about everbody, everybody thinking that David's really weak while Goliath is the, is a huge giant. But ins-, in the other sense, instead uh David had uh his character and had something uh a weapon that actually we had misconceptions of, misconceptions about uh that actually helped him uh to defeat the giant. So this is one of his stories, but another story is, another thing about uh Malcolm Gladwell that I like to read about is that he has an online blog. In this online blog, he doesn't update it much, maybe uh few maybe once a few months, but I've read all the posts. And one thing that I like about is that uh he connects every social uh phenomenon or economic uh question into really uh easy daily life words. So that I can really uh understand and really talk about it very easily. Because usually uh, about these topics, you would have a hard time to comprehend it. But um Mr. Gladwell has made it really easy for myself to understand uh his works and also about his comments on social phenomenon. So this is why I enjoy Gladwell's books a lot.",,,24.3

So, my recorder teacher came in and asked us, Alright so, who is interested in signing up for a band? That was the first decision I ever made for myself. I raised my hand, and I volunteered.

So, I volunteered and became a trumpet propeller in the band.

I was like what am I gonna do? like I just started to find like bits and pieces of myself. So, I decided to reach out. Umm, I begged my mom to roam. If I mean like music teacher, I don't care what instrument as long as I am doing music, as that is what I love, and she found me umm a great violin teacher, and I started studying with her, and it became really serious, like every week it would be like a two hour lesson, and she would like, my teacher would yell at me every time, and she would be like you are not practicing enough, and then it was then when I was like, is this really what I want? Is this, is music am I doing, do I love music because of all the friends that I can make, and now I cannot make any friends because its a private lesson? and do I really want to continue? So, as I don't really like to take any risk as a kid. So, I was like okay I started it, and I should finish it. So, umm instead of just through private lessons, I reached out and I joined like a little orchestras, and I met a bunch of new friends, and it was in the orchestra show that I decided, well friends are important, but I found out that music is what I am passionate about. So, in high school I joined a band, there was a band, so I became a tuba player, so I learned bass club which is pretty hard for me, cause I am always the melody and this was umm, should I stop? Okay. Alright.",,,25.1

So, I saw a flyer in the girls locker room and it was uh fencing. Girls it was a PSAL fencing um team that they recruiting. I walked in uh with two of my friends well, I dragged them there because I was too I was mmm a bit too nervous as a freshman to go in alone you know and so I went and then um I found out because there is so there's such um low interest in fencing because of the prices that attached to it because you have to buy your own whole set of equipment. I found myself only like uh ten-ish other girls and I decided after it like seeing like the seniors and juniors fence I watched a match I decided it was the thing for me. So, I begged my mom I was like mom you have to get this for me like the whole set of equipments around like three hundred bucks. So, I made a um promise to her that if I were to go into this sport I will go in for four years I will not give up midway. So, I thought sure like how hard it's only like the season is only two months so two months every year its like what uh eight months. Well I think. So, um it turns out to be way harder than I thought it would be. So, um the first two weeks of my um the two months seasons all I did was uh drills, uh wall sit, um like it was it was running the stairs, up and down the stairs it was a nightmare like I didn't  I didn't even get to do the cool stuff you know. So, after like three weeks pass um my coach finally taught us how to um do like a fencing position on guard you know and then another three weeks pass by um it was and then we started to get to pick our weapon. By that time I was so happy I was like no more wall sits and stuff.So I picked my weapon but the majority of the time right before practices we spent like sixty percent of the time doing like foot works and stuff and we only used like forty percent of the time to actually touch the weights and stuff but it was a really worthwhile experience um even after I graduate of course I get to fence more as a senior because I am on the like varsity team but it was definitely a decision that I don't regret.

It was the best decision I made. And for like the first two weeks I was like in complete denial. I was like ""I did not get selected, I'm not in camp, I'm not away for, home for another eight weeks"" because it's an overnight camp with others, other international girls. So I was really really...I felt really weird, I was like ""Oh I never did this before"" but like. I'm really excited but I was like a little bit held back because it seems kinda too good to be true, you know kinda thing? But in camp I really learned, uh, it was a leadership camp, so I really learned to, of course, the cliche part, become a leader. But the bigger part of it was just open my eyes to, there's so many perspectives out there. Since I like girls from, like really peers my age from Japan, um, there's one from like London and like um, I think there's one from Barbados. Like we all come together, we all collaborated, we do chores together and like we have project time where we like make designer projects for the camp. For example I, the one I was on, the Stargazing Power. So, which is pretty awesome. And then um come the night, after dinner every day for um Monday through Friday, we'll have an evening discussion where we talk about topics like, where we talk about global warming, like feminism, like um and then politics. And it was just be amazing because there's a saying that like you learn your history, like your country's history more from another country than your own country yourself. So there are a lot of things that -- I'm from China as you can see -- I learned a lot of things about China that I never learned before. Because I went to school in China, so I took like, like history classes there and it'd be amazing. I mean, of course if I went to school in America, I would learn about China's history, but it would still be different if you were learning from like a European perspective of that, like China, versus an American perspective. And there's just, our perspectives are really different. And this just taught me to, not to think that what I learned is right. So, from that experience I learned as a life lesson that to always be unbiased and to cultivate as many sources before I can make a uh well-rounded judgment. Yeah.",,,25.3

This hobby, well I don't really know how to describe this hobby cause I never had this hobby before when I was younger, but then as I grew up, and grew up, I figured I really should go with this hobby since it really characterizes me.This hobby of mine is called dancing, and I first started realizing this when I was in Junior High, and Junior High was little bit interesting, because a lot of things happened with young people in that age, and what I figured is that a lot of nastiness that happens, and that's not really how I think human being should operate on, because we're not worth of on the younger perception of dancing which unfortunately comments so, this really sort of immortalizing desensitizing the sentence, and I figured that out when I went to my first school dance and there was something called grinding, and you know I thought to myself, what is this? this isn't actually a dance. I talked to the newest teacher about it, and you know what they say to me? They said, he said this is considered a dance, but I don't think that's true, because when you're doing it to a girl or when a guy does to a girl, and that's a situation, it's not healthy. When you're doing a certain moves on a person, you start to realize though you may like it in that one sense, you may think that you are enjoying yourself, but what are you really doing? You're putting your own private parts close to someone and you're pretending that you're liking it, but you're not really developing a sort of emotional connection. So well, that connection is very superficial, that's nothing almost pretty much. Why is that? Because you're not really connecting emotionally, you're only getting physically. Any relationship that we see out there, is not started based on that, it started on nurturing each other. Why I learned and starting dancing is because, just think of a romantic dancing; There's movie out there, they show romanticism in dancing, they show calmness, sweetness in every move, and that tenderness that you feel when you touch them, and you feel that you're connected, she is the one on the first day of your dancing, that may mean everything to you. But, when you do something like grinding on someone, what are you really feeling? are you really getting the sort of satisfaction? you may think that oh, you are feeling the satisfaction, because you know, you are physically satisfied, but what is that you being physically satisfied, but are you actually gonna do something with her in the long run? Are you actually planning on making your first impression of her in grinding, and then all of a sudden you must have married her, because you were grinding up her. Does that happen? Maybe, I don't really know since I can't think of marriage as an actual college student at the same time though, you think yourself, is that being romantic? I'd want to ask you this.",,,26.1

I am always going somewhere, doing something. So, I really appreciate those times or when I can take time to just sit down and relax. But, I always feel bad about it. Like at home, during the summers, I usually take you know, one day a month just like sit on the couch and doing nothing all day. But, I always feel horrible about it at the end of the day. So, I picked up crochet, and its really changed those lazy days. Now, I don't feel bad about being lazy anymore, cause I actually come out with a solid result at the end of the day, and so I've always been around crochet. My mum crochet's, my grandmother crochet, all my aunts crochet. I was very intimidated to start crochet, because all of them were so good, and I thought I would never get up to their level being so amazing making afghans and blankets, and all sorts of crazy beautiful things. But, once my mum showed me how to do it, it was a lot easier than I actually thought. Its all one basic stage, and then everything else just builds on that concept. So, the first thing that I ever made was a tiny little blanket, and it only used a couple different stitches, and I was done with that in a week. I just loved it so much, and all of the patterns for crochet are made in the same journal form. So, its always easy to pick up any run or learn a new stitch cause they are all made in the same format. So, I really like that, and lets see; the crochet gift are also the best. Handmade things they always get to people, like last Christmas, I made my mum a scarf. I spent maybe an hour, an hour and a half actually crocheting it, and she cried cause she loved it so much. She wore it everyday that winter, and just absolutely loved it. Told all her coworkers, told everyone she knew that like, oh my daughter made this for me, and she loved it just so much, and that was like an hour and a half for work. So, its really great to just be able to be productive, and still have time to relax, and you can also donate things that are out of crochet,  and really a great way to give back to the community, and relax and have a lot of fun.",,,27.1

Its an online game called Cookie Clicker, and its kind of taking control of my life for the past few days. I started a few days ago, and because one of my friends is too into it. He has been working on it for over a year, and I am pretty convinced that he is one of the top ten in the world in this game, and it all starts, you get on the website, and there is one cookie and you click it, and then each time you click the cursor on the cookie, you would get another cookie, and soon once you have quite a few cookies maybe 20, 30 then you can start buying some upgrades. So, the first upgrade you can get is called a cursor. Its an additional cursor that umm goes on the cookie, and clicks once every ten seconds. And after that, they get a little progressively more ridiculous. The next one is called a Grandma, so its just what it sounds like. You buy a grandmother to bake cookies for you, and it starts off pretty slow, but and get to that layer, and then you can buy cookie farms, cookie mines, and cookie factors. Each of which either grow cookie plants, create cookies in a factory, or my cookies from the ground and after that you can get a cookie shipment from the cookie plant, and each of these are progressively more expensive, and they each uhh start adding more cookies to your total cookie count without you having to click anything. So, after a while you get into incredible ridiculous upgrades lets see, I think the two most ridiculous are the antimatter condenser which condenses antimatter into cookies, and alchemy lab that turns the gold into cookies because that's now more important than gold, and then a prism which turns right itself into cookies, and after a while you get a little obsessed at least I have, and then you can start buying upgrades for each of these assistance that you had. So, you can buy upgrades that will make umm, your grandmothers more efficient, and really right now I have over trillion cookies, and I started two days ago. So, yeah I uhh, its a great game, but I think I should really start cooking myself.",,,27.2

I have to say it all started back in Middle School, when I got my first iPod nano. It was the first one that can play music videos, and I was one of the coolest kids in my grade. I absolutely loved it. I had no idea that something like that even existed, and only Apple could make something like that. After that, my love stayed pretty steady until High School, when as part of my school's program, I was given a Mac book, uhh classic white ones, absolutely beautiful, and with my iPod, I could now connect them, and they worked beautifully together, and that was something I never experienced before. And then, I got my iPhone, my first iPhone, the iPhone 4 and then my life changed. It, I had no idea that technology could work together so well. I started using i cloud,  I started using sort of sinking my calendars, and it was amazing, and that was really when I started becoming a fan-girl. I, my first release was the iPhone 5 release. I actually skipped class in High School to go watch it, and I cried a little bit, because just the fact that a company could have that big of a following and that many people could be so excited for the release of a product was amazing, and that's something I have never experienced with any other company. Now, this past month, it has been pretty exciting for me with the release of the iPhone 6 and the Apple watch, its been a big week, big month, and I uhh, and the announcement of the iPhone 6 was on Friday at 1'o clock or a Tuesday at 1'o clock, and I had Chemistry. So, I ran back to my dorm, put on my Apple t-shirt, an authentic employee t-shirt courtesy of e-bay, and sat down to watch the release, and it was incredible.

From a young age, I was exposed to nerd culture in all forms. Everywhere from science fiction, to video games, and to the one part that I never thought I'd venture into, which was comic books. I thought, comic books are for boys, nobody reads those, they're just sitting in Dad's basement collecting dust, right? No, wrong. My Dad introduced me to my first comic book, which was the Walking Dead, when I was just a little girl. And I read the first one and I was instantly hooked. I wanted to collect as many as I could, I read through every single one he had in no order whatsoever, just for the fun of it. I wanted to know everything because I was so obsessed with it. When I got older and as the years passed and I had already forgotten about it, I figured out that there was going to be a show about it. A real show with real people, not just comic book people. And that, I was so excited for that. I did research on the characters, I re-read every comic book I owned. I bought merchandise, tee-shirts, I was so excited. Before I even, before I even got to see the show. When it finally did come out, I watched every episode multiple times, probably too many times to be considered healthy. But let's face it, I was obsessed. [laughter] My obsession kinda stems from when I was younger, I was in Girl Scouts. And I was involved in a lot of like survival training and emergency response training as I got older. And all of that kind of cultivated in my mind just some crazy zombie apocalypse idea, that I would survive. Because I've got the training, I've got the skills, I've got the know-how, and I'm not afraid to kill zombies. So I'm going to survive. I think we all know that in real life, if there was a zombie apocalypse, if that was to happen, we would all be dead. [laughter] But no, not me, I would survive.

Immediately my mind clicked on and I said okay, I need to analyze this, I need to figure out what it means. And I took the first word and I thought saluti, what could that mean? It's not good morning because it's not morning anymore, it's not good evening because it's not the night. It's some kind of greeting, it's like salutations, salutations. So salutations, no that word is, what, what could it mean, what does that mean. Discipli, it says greetings something. It's not friends, not something. Disciples, it's students, it's greetings students. He just said greetings, students. I thought: I've got this, I'll ace this class. Well little did I know that I'd not only ace the class but that I'd also become a state vocabulary champion for Latin in Texas. I went to a very small high school, and there were only two languages offered. It was either Spanish or Latin. And being that I wanted to get involved in the medical community, I chose Latin, because I figured it would help me with medical terminology. And that's a t-word, so I'm too ??. I heard that Latin Club was a huge part of the school, and that we went to Nationals every year. That's so many people followed Latin Club and just loved it. So I figured I'd try it. And I quickly became the school's vocabulary specialist. As a freshman. And I went on and competed in Area, and State, for the Latin competitions in vocabulary. But I didn't place at all, in anything I did. And I even tried out with Vocal Solo, representing my school with a solo ensemble, where I prepared like a Latin s- song or aria or something like that, I don't even remember anymore.  But um next year I tried again, I worked a little harder, I changed my study habits, I I thought more about what to do when I was actually taking the test and. I remember after I took it, at the Area competition, I I thought I blew it. I figured I didn't know anything and I wasn't going to place even close to top ten. [laughter] There were three people sent from my school. There were me and two other girls who were all competing to move onto State, because I obviously didn't show results in the past year. [laughter] So the announcer at the awards ceremony was calling out fifth, fourth, third, fourth, fifth, [laughter], fifth through first.  And he, my other two competitors were fifth and fourth.  And I figured, alright, that's it for me, I'm just gonna try again next year. But I totally zoned out, and I thought about everything I could have done.  And then I heard the announcer call out first place, and I was like oh, I want to listen to this, maybe it's somebody I know from another school. And I heard my school. And everybody's eyes just shot to me, and it didn't even occur to me that it could be me.  And he, the announcer said my name, and all I could focus on was running up and grabbing my trophy. And then, from then, I'm so glad that I was able to compete. Because Latin isn't a dead language, it'll live forever in the hearts of students and teachers, all around the world.",,,29.3

Umm, saxophone is one of my favorite instruments. I actually played uhh the alto saxophone, which I think was really really nice sound, and I played that through middle school and half of high school. Umm one of my favorite parts about playing the saxophone was being in the jazz band. Umm so, I was in the jazz band probably for four years, umm somewhere in middle school, and somewhere in high school, and uhh the jazz band is just, was just one of those experiences that was really umm relaxing for me, really uhh kind of de-stress, de-stressing uhh you just go in a room, and you know you just be like playing and jamming with all these people, and uhh creating this really cool rifts and things like that umm, so that was definitely a large part of my musical experience, and I thought that was really great, and uhh, uhh another thing that I did that was in 9th grade was I started to sing in school. Umm, I started to uhh join the choir, I joined the school musical, and umm I also joined the altopoli group in my school, umm all of which were extremely fun, and umm I also began taking voice lessons umm with the same teacher that has been teaching me uhh about the piano all these years. Umm and yes, soon enough like after 1 or 2 years, I began umm joining all stage choirs, and all national choirs and stuff like that, and umm which I thought were very very umm fun, and uhh a great, great way to meet musicians from all over the countries especially in the national choir umm you really get to understand people's backgrounds, and things like that, and just kind of come together with all these great musicians, and I thought that was really an amazing thing.",,,30.2

Um, and it's my one of my favorite movies for a few reasons. One reason is that Leonardo Dicaprio is starring in it. Um, Leonardo Dicaprio is one of my favorite actors um he's been in movies like Titanic, uh The Departed Um and things like that. Um, and just all of those movies have been I think uh made into these iconic films because of his portrayal of the characters. Um, I think he really brings something to movies that kind of captivates the audience um in a way that not every actor can do. Um, another reason that I really like this movie are the plot twists. So, in this movie a lot of things are changing, um almost every few minutes um. When you are watching the movie things will start to happen and you'll you'll be thrown completely off guard. You'll say wow like I never expected this wow like I never imagined that this could have happened I never I wasn't thinking of the movie in this way and all of a sudden it turned into a different type of thing. Um, so that is one another reason why I like the movie. Um, one of the other reasons is in the imagery in the  movie um, I actually think the imagery was outstanding in this movie it really brought the all of the different stories and all of the different themes kind of together um throughout the whole movie. Um, for example I just I can always remember like when I think of this movie I can remember the scene where he's standing in his house with ah ashes just raining down all around him um which you know signifies a fire that had happened in his house and I remember like the frozen uh dead bodies that were just kind of piled up um during the holocaust when he was a soldier. Um, and I can also remember the view out of his window to the lake which uh had a lot of meaning in the movie. This lake kept reappearing and these bodies kept reappearing especially of these two girls. Um, and just all of these flashbacks with different imagery and things like that really I think brought the movie together and just made it a masterpiece.",,,30.3

What makes a good superhero? I guess its subjective as a whole for a lot of people, but for me the most important thing is that a superhero is interesting if their characters are interesting. That's why for me Batman is my favorite character, and it doesn't have super powers. He wasn't born like the flash or superman where they just have powers granted to them through some accidents or that's just their species. He kinda fell into a world of vigilantism, and it's stopping crime engulfing city, and I think that's a very important aspect of Batman, that can be taken a lot from. Batman suffered through huge tragic loss, and from this tragic loss he found this inspiration to start a better city, and a better himself as a result. Now later, we're gonna talk about why that's actually a very interesting thing, and not necessarily very good, but for now I think, its interesting enough to start to realize that this was a man who was pushed to his  limits, and as a result started pushing people to limits, and that itself is much more interesting than any alien from Krypton can inspire me. Now, when we look at Batman, we start analyzing his behavior, we realize that he's just a man who's running around gulping the city dressed up as a bat. Now on its surface it sounds pretty crazy, but if you try to analyse why he's doing this, then you start to kinda get some sense that this broken man is showing us what maybe individual people would want to do with themselves. People always have power fantasies where they wanna go around and then save the person who was getting bugged, or they want to stop the guy who was stealing some woman's purse, but Batman is actually going out and doing that.  Now, he has the benefit of money, but without the money would he still be able to do that? and there are some story elsewhere where Batman deprived and limited in what he can do, but he still ends up trying to save the day which I think is a huge, a huge record aspect of what makes it a really interesting superhero than anybody else. Now, another thing about Batman is that the world he set in, is a world of extremes. You have characters like the joker, the riddler who get hung up on this one aspect of humanity where joker just sends his chaos for everybody. The riddler, just wants to confuse everybody and wants to expose his intelligence, and in this world Batman is the pure exposure of vigilantism, and taking matters into his own hands. ",,,31.1

You're either going to understand why I like this show a lot, or you're gonna just laugh at me, so while it will show up. That show is Avatar: The Last Airbender. Let me make my case for why this TV show made for 8 to 12 year old, is actually a fantastic TV show that everybody should watch including parents with their own children. Now, Avatar: The Last Airbender at its surface level, is a story about a child who has to save the world. He is the last stand for an entire culture and an entire body of people, and he is basically the quintessential element of his own kind of ability to manipulate error. He is the element of air and body. This is the world where everybody has fantastical powers or they are't able to manipulate this power. If people can manipulate your error, fire, earth, or water,. Now early at its surface, children are going to be excited about this, because why wouldn't wanna be able to watch a TV show where people can just move rocks with their mind, or move water and then freeze it and then stop the bad guys or become the bad guys. Its a very interesting concept, and when you put that in conjunction with people who aren't able to do these things, you're already setting up a very very interesting dichotomy to who is in power, and then who else has the power that they can obtain without it. Now, that's getting into later stuff. Now going to Aang, who is the last airbender, he needs to learn all these elements. So, he is going through all these different cultures learning about what makes them special and unique and applying it to his own culture which is an error, almost like a Buddhist monk type of lifestyle. Now, you are contrasting this with entire nations who embodiment a war of nations of an entire militant state, and he also goes cultures to cultures written by very native tribes that are tribal and they have traditions and they hold those values, and he also have cities that are developing and starting to invest in technology. Now this is kind of the mean point of all these different cultures much like our own earth. Now, this kind of set up alone already makes Avatar: The Last Airbender so interesting, but what makes it even better is that by putting children into the world, you're already eliminating some of these ideas of prejudice and fear, and more ideal for the aspect of change in this world which is all what the show is about. It's about Aang, changing this world for the better, and by forcing him to go along and one of all these cultures by giving him a role of protector of the route without having to be the final and only person protecting the world, you're setting the stage for so much great discussion about what makes a culture great, what makes a culture unique, and why came this along, and these things alone make Avatar: The Last Airbender such a fantastic show without even talking about the animation and the goofiness and the relationships that happen in the show, and how attached he gets them, all of that comes included with the territory of such a great foundation of environment and basically a great more. And that's why Avatar: The Last Airbend is a great show.",,,31.2

One book that does this very well for me, sets the story for me very well, and got me through an entire series that ended up being a closer phenomenon is Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone. This book took a magical world and placed it inside our own. It coexists with people down the street going to school within this room are people born with magical abilities, and doing fantastic amazing things that has to be hidden from public. That alone, I feel is a very interesting concept, because you have this entire group of people who are working, who have so much change that are basically not the part of the greater scheme of things or conversely, you can say that they are the arbors of all things that happen in this world, and then their own people are just living  in it. This already said some kind of an interesting conversation, because in this world, you are telling a story that of a boy who shouldn't die in the very beginning of the series, and instead goes on to amazing things and tries to create the world of very very potentially evil thing happening in this world. Now, the reason I chose Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone as my favorite book was because of how it setup this entire world. We get hints that there is evil and terror in this world, but it starts off with Harry Potter, who is 11 years old learning that he is a magical being instead of this normal day to day every going to school kind of a boy, but he is pretty much forced to live undercover type of a person, and I don't if you know anybody like that personally, but when he learns of this, everything he has, has a sense of wonder and amazement, and that alone draws the young readers in which gets propagated through this series, and by the end of that all, even though some of the genuine interest and amazement that's gone, you still have the very powerful, the very deep feelings of mortality and of permanence, and of moving on past those amazing things, and it all started with book one, where you just have a boy who runs through a wall and gets onto a train, and travels to a new school.",,,31.3

He is, you can't say that about many superheros, umm first of all he is a billionaire, that's only match by like Iron man I guess, but he's also a playboy that's also like Iron man. But, he knows a whole lot more martial arts and he is a philanthropist, so he actually gives back, and umm some people kinda criticize Batman, saying he doesn't really have any superpowers, but you don't really need superpower to be a superhero as long as you can motivate people to help others. Batman is a symbol for changing Gotham, and stopping crime, and some people criticize Batman, because he doesn't kill people, he doesn't kill mass murders like the joker, and one reason for that I guess is umm, he doesn't want to become like the criminals that he is fighting, but I think another reason is because, Batman is a symbol of hope. He thinks that everyone can be changed, and that's his main message. He's trying to encourage everyone else to also his superheros, and to help others umm, and stop crime, and that's I think the main criteria of being a superhero, and Batman fills it so well, and a lot of people think that their favorite superhero is Batman, but the only thing they've seen of Batman is like the movies or something like that, but I have like a whole shelf of like Batman graphic novels. He is like an awesome superhero, and I have spent like my entire childhood just reading everything that Batman has done, and all of it different graphic novel artists, and uhh yeah, he is just a really great superhero.

Umm the budget was just like 7000 dollars, but that was just, so what made that movie great was that every single shot was purposely hold, and then went down in advance, and that's what I really love about it, and another thing that was great about Primer was that the plot was so difficult to follow, and it was really, it required a lot of mental effort and that's what I liked about movies, umm it's really thought provoking. Umm like for instance, I have a poster that kind of charts the plot lines of like five different movies, so one of them is 12 Angry Men. This is like 12 lines at the horizontal, another is Lord Of The Rings, and that's really complicated, because there are so many different characters and they include like sauron and whatever, but for Primer, the graph is just like a bunch of squiggly lines, because no one really knows what happens in that movie. Umm but this summer, this past summer, I watched Before Sunrise, which is another really really big movie, and that's my favorite movie now , and umm contrary to Primer, there actually isn't really a plot to Before Sunrise, its just two people talking umm for the entire two hours, umm but like Primer, its incredibly thought provoking, and I learned so much from that movie, and it was part of like a three part, its a part of a trilogy. Umm basically its umm involves two people, that meet on a train, and they get off a train, and that they find that they really enjoy each others company, and they don't want to live each other, and then by the end of the movie, they agree to meet up in I think nine months. Umm  but, that single, that entire movie is just a single conversation, that umm really goes into a lot of thought provoking and really interesting ideas.",,,32.2

I remember uhh last summer, or two summers ago, I was in Boston, and I saw a magician, a very simple magician doing like kid stage magician and then after the show, I did some magic tricks to the kids that were in the show, and they were more amazed by me than that professional guy.

For those who aren't familiar with The Lord Of The Rings, the book is a tale of a creature called a Hobbit who comes into a possession of something called a ring of power which is a device of extreme evil, and his task with destroying this device in fire from once it came. Fortunately, he doesn't have to do this alone. He had many friends to help him. He goes to The Council of Elrond, which is the council of elves who nominate 8 members to become members of the fellowship of the ring. These people then actually travel to a land called Mordor, where there are tasks with destroying the ring. Unfortunately, this is not an easy task. Frodo faces such dangers like giant spiders, ghosts, oaks, twirls, its not easy. In face, he loses many of his friends along the way. But, he manages to survive above it, because this is not just an ordinary fairy story, this is a tale of personal dedication. This is a tale of perseverance, of heroism, not the mind, not the body, but of the spirit. Its this story that is able to touch so many lives across the world. It teaches those who read it, that no matter what kind of hardships you're faced with, no matter what sort of trouble you're tasked with, you can persevere and rise above it. Interestingly enough, this bears a lot of the mote eves of the north mythology. For instance, the land where Frodo lives is called the Middle Earth, which is the reference to the North Midgard, which literally translates to Middle Earth. There is the fact that there are rings of power. This is a reference to the nor-smith of all the rings of power. Eregion was gifted the rings by the elves, and his rings got several other rings and he holds true dominion and control over all of those who wear these rings. So, in conclusion, The Lord Of The Rings is the story that is not just for children or adults, its one for all generations, its one that will touch all cultures and that it will teach all people important lessons.  Thank you!",,,15.1

That is the discipline of musical cognition.  Musical cognition is a way for me to combine my 2 passions for music and neuroscience.  Music has been a tremendous part of my life ever since I was very young, 4 years old to be exact.  So that's when I started taking violin lessons.  I started taking violin lessons because I developed this really strong desire to learn to play the violin after I had seen a children's orchestra perform Scheherazade by Rimsky-Korsakov.  It was after this point that I decided I wanted to be a musician.  So I spent, I spent the past 14 years learning to play the violin and my passion for violin has extended into other instruments.  I can play anything from daduke to piano to voice and it's this skill that I want to be able to apply into the field of medicine.  So, neuroscience has also been a tremendous passion of mine.  I was kind of thrust into it when I was 4 years old when I started having these really strong painful headaches and mood swings and it wasn't until a couple weeks later til I found out I had cancer.  I will have been diagnosed with a cranial forigioma, a rare form of brain cancer and by the time the doctors had performed a craniotomy to remove it, it was about the size of a ping pong ball.  But, I still wanted to play the violin  and I feel like violin has been a tremendous healing process.  I feel like it has increased my neuroplasticity.  I've become stronger, smarter, I can function more easily as a result of music.  Now I first found out that I could combine these two passions when I was about 13.  I was in a local second-hand book store and I found a book called Music Affilia, which is written by Oliver Sats, who is a prominent neuroscience researcher at New York University.  And, I read this book and I discovered that there is a lot that we don't know about music.  I've read about a woman who has seizures induced by certain types of music.  I've read of affezia patients who are able to suddenly speak as a result of learning songs.  I've learned of people who walk away from car accidents with the ability to play a piano.  I knew then and there that I wanted to be a neurologist.  I wanted to be a musical cognition researcher.  This passion of mine continued to grow and I continued to research what else can be done with music.  It's my view that in the years to come, I'm going to find new uses for music in the field of neuroscience.  I'm going to help people heal.  I'm going to help them to become smarter, stronger, all through the sharing of my gift for music.",,,15.2

Right, so the first step is safety, that is the most important step, you want to make sure that you have proper equipment, such as covered shoes, long pants and long-sleeved shirt, preferably with darker color. So that you can move around relatively undetective. Um. The next thing you're going to want is a proper weapon. It needs to be registered with the local authorities, it needs to be safe, it needs to be regularly cleaned. That way there's no danger in using this weapon. Which, it is a weapon, but it's also a tool. Alright. And proper equipment: extremely useful.  Eh. Err, um. Um, yeah, I have equipment, so it's, alright. After you've gotten your equipment, the next step is to find where you're going to hunt, and plan it out with all the local landowners in that general area. You want to make sure there's no houses, there's no urban areas, there's no places where anyone could be in danger, there's no one hiking. You want to get a feel for the area before you go there. Walk around the place where you'll be hunting, check for wind direction, ambient noise, what, how many animals, the signs, just get prepared before you go out with your weapon. Because that's when it's most dangerous and you want to be sure that you're safe and that people around you are safe. The next step is planning a date and time for when you're gonna hunt. You want to make that your family and friends know when you're going to be hunting and how long you'll be hunting. So that if you do take too long, they can call for the authorities to make sure that you're okay. Alright, so when you go out hunting, you're gonna wanna gear up with your proper equipment, your covered, covered shoes, your pants and your shirt. You also want to bring a backpack with, you want to bring a backpack with all your provisions. You want some food, you want a knife, a portable shovel, and some water. Eh and then when you go out hunting, first thing you're gonna do, is you're gonna look for sign. And once you find sign, then you'll wanna chamber a bullet into your weapon. But you wanna lower the hammer and put on the safety, to ensure that it's safe. That way you can walk around with a loaded weapon, but it is not in danger of going off and hurting yourself or anyone around you. When you find your animal, you want to line up the shot with a clear backstop such as a hill, or a very thick tree. You don't want to take a shot unless, if there's any risk of anything going wrong. If there's rocks behind the shot, it can cause damage to yourself, or the animal and it's just not worth taking the risk. So make sure you have the perfect shot before you go, before before you take it. Once you take your shot, you're gonna wanna give the animal ten to twenty minutes to die. Because if you go up to the animal immediately, it'll begin panicking and running away, which can be very stressful for the animal, it can ruin the meat. And also there's a chance that you'll lose the meat, which means not only, you killed the animal, it suffered, and it got away and no one no one prospered.  So next thing you're gonna do is field dress the animal. You're gonna wanna prepare the meat and as cleanly as possible so you can hang, first we hang up the animal by its hindlegs, uh remove its head so it can begin bleeding out, flushing out all the blood from the body. And then you're gonna wanna start dividing. 'kay.",,,16.1

I find that it's a really interesting activity uh, because it gets you outside, you can run around all sorts of places, you can discover new places while you're doing it because there's not a lot of sports besides maybe like um or exercises besides maybe running, or bicycling that uh would get you outside and would allow you to explore new places and travel new places even if it's just within a local radius. I find that the appeal of walking and transportation using your own muscle uh has really been lost nowadays. I know a lot of people who would be reluctant to walk even a few blocks when they could drive and I think that this is kind of uh unfortunate because it's really good to get out there it's not only healthy to walk but it's also sometimes very interesting to see what's going on around you when you're stuck in your car I mean you have your windshields you can look out and listen but it's just not the same as actually being there and able to interact with your surroundings. Um, I also find that it's ah really rewarding. It's nice to be able to find that your, your feeling very tired but to be able to push yourself that uh, that long way and being able to say ""hey"" I'm not quite far enough. I need to keep going for a little bit longer and being able to do that and feel that accomplishment from doing that. Where then you get home and your exhausted but you know you've, you've accomplished something and you've uh really feels like at least that uh you've, you've done something with your time. I find that it's also can be almost a meditative experience with being able to run or even bicycle uh while listening to music and just be where you are and feel be able to go fast and not in the sense that we are going a million times faster than you're intended to. Uh, whereas maybe a convertible that's, that's faster than our ancestors have ever gone but being able to go as fast as you can go.",,,17.3

Uh, it unfortunately only had a couple of seasons but what really made this show interesting is how it had this kind of descent into madness and what I mean by that is in the first episode we have this it's almost like a soap opera with a little bit of mystery. Like alright, this show is okay and as time goes on it actually starts to change things, start to get stranger. There is something weird about these people and then you kind of get that confirmed a little bit. Someone has this prophetic dream or something like okay could be a coincidence, but it could be something weird going on and then towards middle to end of the first season it completely delves into the supernatural and suddenly your in the middle of all this crazy strange stuff and then suddenly it stops and your like did that really happen? Did it really get that crazy because now it's back to normal and everyone's kind of back to normal doing their day to day tasks and then it starts descending into the strange again. So, it's kind of cool I like the show because it's fairly slow so the build up to this is really nice your like everytime you see something strange your like did that happen? Is it just a coincidence, but as these things start to build and you see more and more there is no way this is a coincidence until you get to that big climax where it's like this is definitely happened. Um, so this show is really cool not only because of it's general progression but also how the characters in the show came to acknowledge the progression themselves. So, one of the characters the main character Agent Cooper he from the very beginning has this belief in this mysticism he believes in the dreams he has being prophetic and giving him clues and everyone else is a little skeptical of him, they don't really know him well he just came into town, he is an outsider, But as they get to know him as they see what his dreams tell him coming true they begin to realize that maybe there is something strange going on here. Maybe we should believe this crazy guy and they themselves also mentally start going into this sort of dark, deep, something strange supernatural is going on. Which, I think is pretty cool it's like they're with the audience progressing into this weird new place. So, this show also is really cool because not only does it have this main story line where all this strange stuff is going on but there's a lot of strange stuff that has nothing to do with the main story that happens in this world. Which, kind of helps solidify both for the audience and for the characters in the show that something strange is going on. For example, there is this one woman she bumps her head gets amnesia pretty traditional for a soap opera type show, uh, but she also gets super-human strength. There is never an explanation for why she has this strength and eventually she loses her memory again and goes back to being who she was before without the strength. With no explanation, nothing, and I kind of like that. It was kind of a random thing that just kind of showed another small piece of this really strange world and that's one of my favorite shows.",,,18.1

This class is kind of interesting because it was actually in the philosophy department But me with my math background thought it would be kind of interesting because math is a lot of logic so this would be pretty fun and it was in fact, a really fun class. It was an interesting class because it was a lot like math we had these symbols and letters and we used those to prove different things. At the same time, it was very different because it was more general I could use it for things like arguments and it was nice because it was also very straight forward. In math we have a couple of basic rules of the universe that we know and we assume to be true at least and then we make other the other sort of hypotheses based on these and then prove them using these different rules and from there we get all kinds of different areas of math. The problem is especially at a lower level a lot of this math is just the math requires to prove something simple is so complex that you can't really teach it in the classroom that early and so you basically have to take people's words that this is true But with logic you can go through the very most basic of ideas and steps and it's simple. You, the rules are all simple you can understand where they come from you can derive them pretty easily and the class is interesting because there were a lot of people there who have a philosophy background or they were taking it to learn how to be better debaters and they actually had I think a lot more trouble with this class I was perfectly happy in it uh, but I was actually surprised at my kind of from all that math background and my ability to kind of do this logic pretty straight forwardly and I actually really enjoyed doing the proofs and being able to write things out step by step. It all made sense to me and they actually even asked me to TA it uh after I took that class because I did so well in it but I didn't even know how I would first begin to approach that because for me the logic was just it was all there how, how being explained something and something means both of them right it's as simple as it gets and there's no, there's no way to engrain it besides just remember it I mean it is a rule of the universe. It is a basic rule. Uh, so it was really kind of cool to see people from different backgrounds and how everyone had kind of a different approach to it and from because of their backgrounds had varying levels of difficulty or ease with it. I also like it because like I said you can expand it to other areas past just uh, just math right, you can use it in debate you can use it when you're talking to someone you can even use it just to tell when you are watching tv if someone is the argument is valid or not. So, logic is really useful and I was really happy I took this class and I wish there were more logic classes out there. Thanks. ",,,18.3

Um, it's kinda like the Wall, the Zuccotti Park Wall Street protests, about being in the ninety nine percent. But I don't think it'll go anywhere, it's also feeling really weird cuz when I did go down there to see the people they kinda have a [??] community instead of um actually taking any action against the ninety nine percent. And really they can't really stop them from being majority rules because it's it's just majority's always gonna win entir- entirety um here in America, democracy doesn't really take a big role unless you are in the nin- one percent. Because you don't really have much of a voice in the Congress, unless you want to stop being passive, but that's not what I just learned from [??} book. But in the Climate March they're really fighting against um fracking, and fracking's happening on by the Arctics, just to receive um oil for the people. But the problem is increasing climate change by releasing gas into the air and speeding up global warming and people are freaking out about it, but people don't really look at it as how America has to go fracking to avoid international tensions because if you went to Venezuela or Iraq to get oil from there it can lead to much more international tensions or lead to a nuclear war. And people really don't want that but people don't really look at that way, they just see it as America's trying to hurt the climate, hurt the polar bears but it's really like a game, win win or lose situation. And um if you like ch- ch- choose to be a fracking, understand that there's more risk versus than going to another country, it's just it's also about how you want to care of your people entirely. Like I understand all our caring about what happens in the future versus what's happening right now, but if you don't go resort to fracking, just until the international tension is cooled down, then it's not really going to do anything um for the future people, might just end up going to a nuclear war that will be more um detrimental versus than fracking. Um climate change is the big issue but it is not as a big issue right now as it should be versus health care and stuff. Like a lot of people do make that point about health care um and climate change they're both on the same page when it's really not um, like health care's really more political and and climate change is more environmental. And sad to say environmental's not really that big a thing in the  Congress right now. And as much as you want to care about having just climate change or kinda less change, um you really can't do anything other than just hope that you have to care about whether you want people to stay alive or whether you want, like, changes done to the Arctic. Um I, it is going to have bad, like like effects like raising the water levels but the way you look at it, statistically like usually we use game theory to like calculate the [??] of that, and they actually have calculated about like so if they do um.

So, uhh, before I start talking about which one it is, I'd like to talk about, umm, some of the criteria I would use, uhh, to talk to about choosing my best, my favorite TV series.  So the first thing that I would say, most importantly about TV series, is about how it engages the audience.  So, uhh, for example, if the TV series is a real life documentary, it relates to real life.  So, uhh, it would naturally engage audience.  But then, if it's too boring, too dull, then audience the trouble to really engage themselves in a TV series to be more connected, uhh, with the plot or with the character.  So, uhh, one thing to also to mention is about, for example, some TV series would be, uhh, would be filmed in the, uhhh, for example, in the 90's, 60's setting.  So in that setting, you will naturally be harder to connect.  But then in that case, the key connection for successful TV series is about manipulating the characters and about, uhh, controlling how the characters develop and in turn to engage the audience.  So, the second criteria I think is most important is about how, I would say, how much you enjoy it.  And this depends on what for me?  This depends on, uhh, if I could pause, uhh, the TV series for a second for just going to the toilet because sometimes, uhh, if the TV series, it doesn't allow you to pause it.  It has, uhh, sometimes it would have really engaging scenes that would stop you from taking a pause.  Then it that sense, uhh, I would have, I would have trouble with that.  So, so it's engagement and it's about how enjoyable it is.  And lastly, it's, uhh, how much it's a connection to my social life.  For example, uhh, it would be important that I could discuss that, that TV series with my friends.  Uhh, it would be good dinner conversation.  It would be a good way to connect with my friends.  It's a good way of socialing.  So, in a sense, that TV series should be easy to communicate about.  So after all these criteria, I believe one of my favorite TV series is The Big Bang Theory.  So The Big Bang Theory, uhh, sets in, uhh, sets in a, uhh, sets in a American city.  So in the TV series, the characters are mostly participating in social engagements.  So the TV series would depict how they would, uhh, engage in a social, uhh, in a University cafeteria, how they would engage at home and how the characters interact with each other.  And it's really about how those people are in that's what I really like about the TV series because sometimes, uhh, a really exciting or adventurous part would be great, but personally I would usually prefer a, uhh, a TV series with a focus on how people and how the characters develop.  So, that's, that's about, that's my favorite TV series.",,,24.2

There was a quote in the movie that really spoke to me though. It was when Robin Williams was talking to Matt Damon and the quote went like this: umm, Robin Williams was talking to Damon and he was mentioning how he was criticized by a painting. Matt Damon criticized Williams because of a painting that he had. But what Robin Williams said during that scene really effected me as a person. His quote was like this: it's when he said how he ruined his life by looking at one painting and assumed this whole story and he ripped his life apart. You know that first quote, that Williams said to Damon, that he ripped his life apart, really hit me. But it wasn't over at that point, because there was more to the story then just a painting. Because of all the experiences that he could have gone through, Robin Williams noted that he saw a friend in war. He was in war with a friend, and then he held his dying friend in his hands. And then he asked Damon, does he know how that feels? Because Damon, in that movie, was a prodigy, book smarts, he knew everything. But he didm;t know the actual, tangible feel of a feeling like pain. A feeling like love. If a situation like war were to show up has he actually held his hand? He may have read many books about war, may have read books about, like, the great World War I, World War II, even the most recent wars that happen today. But he hasn't actually felt the hand of his friend, his last breath before he dies. When he talks about love, he may have read books about Shakespeare, you know? Always the typical Romeo and Juliet as well, but when he looks at a woman, straight in the eyes, and actually can feel the love and warmth from her, and if she has cancer one day the terms of visiting hours in the hospital don't apply to you because you feel them. Because you love that person, and i's much more than just reading from a book. And really, you shouldn't really care about all that stuff because you can't learn anything through a book. There's more to things than just a book. It's a whole experience that goes throughout the whole thing. If you're to ask about hardship, about an orphan, maybe not feel what it's like. You can read books, but you grow up as an orphan, do you expect someone growing up with parents understanding the feel of what it's like to be an orphan, just because you read a book like Oliver Twist? Does that encapsulate people? That shouldn't. You're not, shouldn't be, allowed to do necessarily criticism if you don't really know the whole situation. So I guess what I've learned is you can't just take things for granted.",,,26.2

That one word is so big that when someone asks you, oh you're in a relationship with that person or is it something different, if you are in a relationship, that kind of a relationship. It's interesting thing as a relationship, because it can be varied with so many definitions. You can say, relation could be a friendship relationship, you could have the cleanest relationship. You can even have romantic relationships, relationships, relations with your dog, relationship with [??], relationships with anything, it can be anything tangible, can be intangible. Well, now let's talk about human to human relationships romantically. Now, that's even morbid, because you break it down into two different categories.  You have love, you have like, a sort of thing that is real the things that leads into marriage, the things that lead into a prospering family, and then onto the other side you have lust, you have a sort of dark side of a relationship where you see someone, you are attracted by physical looks, maybe something she did to you, but you're not really attracted to her. Well yeah, a lot of people mistake lust for love or mistake love for lust, because of the physical nature of things. A physical nature means a lot. When you look at relationships and focus on long term, long distance relationships, so when long term and long distance relationships when you try and combine both together, how hard can that be? because you're not physically there with someone, you're there mentally, but the physical side sometimes that means so much to someone. Whether the [??] lives somewhere and then feel the romanticism associated with that. But, you can't really do that when you are on a Skype date with her or you are just on the phone. You can only do so much, you can't be physically there, she is just physically exhausted and you just wanna touch everything that wanna make her feel good. But, sometimes you can't do that in long term relationship. You have to wait three months, even a year, even months or years. But, think about that. When you are in a long term relationship and you are eliminating the physical contact, but does that mean that you have to get rid of the relationship in that way. Because, its not just about physical things. Relationships have to matter about physical, its all about what you're actually feeling during a relationship, and that's why one cannot connect that to lust, because lust think about that as superficial sort of love, as a love that's dictated by feelings, as a love of feelings, of physical contact, is there any sort of mental connection? can you connect with someone that is doing something that is causing you to lust, because of what she mentally does to you? You can't really do that, can you? Because you can't feel the sort of emotional attachment that you will get with someone that you would normally interact with, because that's not healthy interaction But, when you look at couples, that have successfully had relationships and marriages have last on for years, that's what makes the difference.",,,26.3

Uhh, one of the reasons is because it's a very hands-on subject and I'm a very hands-on learner.  I don't learn as well typically, umm, in a classroom kind of just listening to a professor or, uhh, even like just reading a lot of material.  Umm, I find that that's harder for me to really grasp, uhh, concepts, umm, as opposed to learning things hands-on.  So computer science is a very hands-on subject.  Some examples of that, umm, are that in computer science, you do a lot of labs where you're given various problems and you have to basically solve them, uhh, given a certain library of functions and, uhh, various tools and classes that you're able to use in order to solve that problem.  Umm, and this way makes it very easy to learn, umm, because it is so hands-on because you can look at all of the information that you're given and apply it.  And when you apply it, umm, I think it kind of really reinforces how certain classes or methods, umm, work in a specific language.  So I think that's one of the reasons why I like computer science so much.  Umm, another reason that I like computer science a lot is that, umm, it's a very creative subject.  There's a lot of room for creativity.  Umm, I'm a very creative person, so, uhh, I sing and I play several other instruments and I act as well.  So, umm, I have a very creative side to me that likes to express itself.  So, in computer science, umm, basically there typically isn't one correct way to solve a problem.  Umm, there are usually many different ways and you're given the, umm, liberty, creative liberty to, umm, basically find your own way, find your own unique way, umm, that best solves the problem for you and that solves it in a way that you can really understand.  And so that's, umm, one of the other major reasons why computer science is my favorite subject.",,,30.1
